# Ghostlight Folio

## What is it?
Ghostlight Folio is a simple application designed to help theatrical stage managers and directors keep track of the various aspects of the shows they work on.

Eventually Ghostlight Folio will support a wide variety of resources.

## Project Roadmap
* Database of `Shows`
* Allow for instances of shows `Productions`
* Allow `People` to be assigned to `Scenes` within `Productions`
* Plan for drag-and-drop blocking behavior for `Scenes`

## Early Tasks
* Start with the ability to add and edit top-level `ShowTemplate` records which will allow crowdsourcing of show data
* Attach `Role` or some similar record to `ShowTemplate` and give it searchable characteristics
* Add search

* Add `Production` model which will allow for instances of shows to be used

## Technologies

* Ruby 3.0.2
* Rails 6.1.4
