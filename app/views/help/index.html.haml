    How does it work?
  %p
    At its core, Ghostlight Folio is broken down into
    = link_to 'Authors', authors_path
    and
    = link_to 'Shows', shows_path
    A show can have multiple authors, and an author can have multiple shows.
  %p
    Shows can have many Roles and Acts (as well as Scenes and French Scenes)
  %p
    Search is an important feature, which can be accessed from the
    %i.fa.fa-search
    icon on the Shows and Authors views. We are trying to provide the ability to find shows and authors
    from diverse backgrounds. Eventually we hope to add similar functionality for searching Roles and Scenes.
